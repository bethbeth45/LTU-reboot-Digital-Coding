Reflection

//Your reflection goes here

In todays session I attempt to catch up with a lesson I wasn't present for. 
I have installed Github desktop and started to use Visual Studio, whereas I was previously shown Codepen. Quite confusing!

This afternoon I will watch the recording of JS session 1 and hopefully be fully caught up in time for session 2.
