Reflection

//Your reflection goes here

The first two weeks of the course I completed on a previous intake where we used CodePen. Work from each session is available on my CodePen account at https://codepen.io/bethbeth45

In todays session I attempt to catch up with a lesson I wasn't present for. 
I have installed Github desktop and started to use Visual Studio, whereas I was previously shown Codepen. Quite confusing!

This afternoon I will watch the recording of JS session 1 and hopefully be fully caught up in time for session 2. 

Yes, fully caught up with the first JS session ready for JS session 2 tomorrow.

Today we started with a task using a function, creating a percentage calculator. 
Next we looked at ElseIf statements
